[Verse 1]
I laid on a dune, I looked at the sky
When the children were babies and played on the beach
You came up behind me, I saw you go by
You were always so close and still within reach

[Chorus]
Sara, Sara
Whatever made you want to change your mind?
Sara, Sara
So easy to look at, so hard to define

[Verse 2]
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand
They run to the water their buckets to fill
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
As they follow each other back up the hill

[Chorus]
Sara, Sara
Sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life
Sara, Sara
Radiant jewel, mystical wife

[Verse 3]
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White
You in the marketplace in Savanna-la-Mar
See Bob Dylan Live

[Chorus]
Sara, oh Sara
It’s all so clear, I could never forget
Sara, oh Sara
Loving you is the one thing I’ll never regret

[Verse 4]
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells
I’d taken the cure and had just gotten through
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel
Writing “Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands” for you

[Chorus]
Sara, Sara
Wherever we travel we’re never apart
Sara, oh Sara
Beautiful lady, so dear to my heart

[Verse 5]
How did I meet you? I don’t know
A messenger sent me in a tropical storm
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow
And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm

[Chorus]
Sara, oh Sara
Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress
Sara, oh Sara
You must forgive me my unworthiness
[Verse 6]
Now the beach is deserted except for some kelp
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore
You always responded when I needed your help
You give me a map and a key to your door

[Chorus]
Sara, oh Sara
Glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow
Sara, oh Sara
Don’t ever leave me, don’t ever go
